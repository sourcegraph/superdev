- [ ] post http endpoint to send a new message for a 'thread'
    - [ ] take the image, clone the repo and pull from main via the link provided, context files, and prompt and execute them using amp via `echo 'PROMPT' | amp`, in a docker container.
      - the repo and context files should be mounted as volumes in the same way as in this file `/Users/lewis/git/superdev/michael/Dockerfile`
    - [ ] the streamed output generated by the docker exec should be stored in memory on the server.
    - [ ] for now, just log the stored output with the thread id to the server console so we can validate it's working.



- [ ] endpoint to read the thread output as a stream
    
- [ ] UI to view the threads
- [ ] persist in memory (for now)
