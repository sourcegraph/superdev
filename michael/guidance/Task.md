# Implement Long-Form Help Text for Root Command

## Description

## Requirements
1. Implement a comprehensive long-form help text for the root command of our CLI application
2. The help text should explain:
    - The purpose of the tool
    - Basic usage patterns
    - Examples of common operations
    - Overview of available commands
    - Where to find more information

## Acceptance Criteria
- Running the application with `--help` displays the new comprehensive help text
- Help text is clear, well-formatted, and provides valuable information to users
- Examples are relevant and demonstrate key usage patterns
- Text adheres to CLI documentation best practices
