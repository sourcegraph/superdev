# Spinner Component

This directory contains the spinner component used to show loading states in the UI.

## Usage

```jsx
import Spinner from './components/Spinner';

// In your component
<Spinner imageUrl="/spinner.png" alt="Loading..." />
```

You need to place a spinner image file (spinner.png) in the public directory of the React app to use this component.
